# The Trial of Sisyphus

## About the Game

"The Trial of Sisyphus" is a challenging arcade-style game inspired by the ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus. Experience the eternal struggle as you take on the role of the cursed king, doomed to push a massive boulder up an ever-steepening hill, only for it to inevitably roll back down.

This game is built using Pygame and features atmospheric parallax scrolling and physics designed to test your endurance and timing.

## The Story of Sisyphus

In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was a cunning king who, for his hubris and for twice cheating Death, was condemned by Zeus to an eternal punishment in the underworld. His torment was to endlessly roll a colossal boulder up a steep hill, only for it to roll back down each time it neared the summit. This game captures a sliver of that eternal, laborious task.

## Objective

Your objective is simple yet daunting: push the boulder as far up the treacherous, procedurally generated hill as you can. The further you push, the higher your score. But beware, the hill gets steeper, and gravity is a relentless foe. If the boulder's momentum wanes and it begins to roll back, or if it stops, your attempt ends.

## Controls

* **Push Boulder**: Alternately press the `Z` and `X` keys. You must alternate between the two keys to successfully apply force.
* **Start Game**: Press `SPACE` on the title screen to begin your trial.
* **Restart Game**: After the boulder stops and the game is over, press `SPACE` to start a new attempt.
